# Personal Website

My personal website built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site generator written in Rust.

## Development

1. Install Zola: `brew install zola`
2. Run the development server: `zola serve`
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:1111` in your browser

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.
