# Getting Started with Rust and AI

As I embark on this learning journey, I've decided to document my progress and share my experiences with both Rust programming and Artificial Intelligence. This blog will serve as both a personal learning journal and a resource for others who might be on a similar path.

## Why Rust?

Rust has caught my attention for several compelling reasons:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Modern tooling and package management
- Growing ecosystem and community

## Why AI?

The field of Artificial Intelligence is transforming our world:
- Rapid advancements in machine learning
- Practical applications across industries
- Opportunity to solve complex problems
- Integration possibilities with systems programming

## Learning Goals

Here's what I plan to focus on:

### Rust Goals
1. Understanding ownership and borrowing
2. Building command-line applications
3. Working with async Rust
4. Contributing to open-source projects

### AI Goals
1. Understanding fundamental ML concepts
2. Implementing basic neural networks
3. Exploring natural language processing
4. Working with modern AI frameworks

## Next Steps

In my upcoming posts, I'll be sharing:
- Code snippets and examples
- Project progress updates
- Challenges and solutions
- Resources I find helpful

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through this exciting journey!
