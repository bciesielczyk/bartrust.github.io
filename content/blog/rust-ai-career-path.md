# My Rust and AI Career Development Path

As I embark on my journey to become proficient in both Rust programming and AI technologies, I've created this roadmap to guide my learning process. This post serves as a reference for my future self and anyone on a similar path.

## Rust Development Path

### 1. Learn Rust Fundamentals
Start by mastering Rust basics:

- Work through "The Rust Programming Language" (known as "the book") - it's free online and the official resource
- Complete Rustlings exercises for hands-on practice
- Use Exercism's Rust track for additional practice problems
- Join the Rust Discord or Reddit communities for help and discussion

### 2. Leverage My QA Experience
My QA background provides valuable transferable skills:

- Testing methodologies translate well to Rust's testing framework
- Debugging experience will help with Rust's ownership/borrowing issues
- Quality mindset aligns with Rust's focus on safety and correctness

### 3. Build Real Projects
Create a portfolio of Rust projects:

- Start with small CLI tools related to my QA work
- Contribute to open-source Rust projects (even documentation or tests)
- Build a more substantial project that showcases Rust's strengths

### 4. Target Relevant Industries
Focus on sectors where Rust is gaining traction:

- Systems programming/embedded systems
- WebAssembly development
- Blockchain/cryptocurrency
- High-performance networking
- Game development

### 5. Get Experience While Still in QA
Before making the full switch:

- Introduce Rust tools in my current QA workflow if possible
- Automate testing with Rust at my current job
- Participate in Rust meetups and hackathons

### 6. Job Search Strategy
When I'm ready to apply:

- Update my resume to highlight relevant technical skills
- Be prepared to discuss how my QA experience enhances my engineering perspective
- Consider intermediate roles that bridge QA and development
- Look for junior Rust positions or general backend roles at companies using Rust

## AI Development Path

### 1. Rust + AI Learning Path
Start with these foundational components:

- Learn Rust fundamentals (as outlined above)
- Build a basic understanding of ML/AI concepts
- Focus on where Rust intersects with AI tooling

### 2. Specific Rust + AI Technologies to Learn
Rust AI Libraries & Frameworks:

- **Burn**: Pure Rust deep learning framework
- **Linfa**: Rust's scikit-learn equivalent for ML algorithms
- **TensorFlow Rust bindings**: Interface with TensorFlow from Rust
- **PyTorch Rust API (Tch-rs)**: Work with PyTorch models in Rust
- **ONNX Runtime**: Run pre-trained models efficiently in Rust

AI Development Areas for Rust:

- Model inference optimization and deployment
- Building high-performance AI pipelines
- Creating AI tooling and infrastructure
- Edge AI and embedded machine learning

### 3. Project Ideas to Build Skills
Start with these progressively challenging projects:

- Create a Rust CLI tool that uses a pre-trained model for simple tasks
- Build a web service that exposes ML functionality via a Rust API
- Develop performance-critical components for AI systems
- Contribute to existing Rust AI libraries

### 4. Career Positioning
Highlight these unique advantages:

- QA expertise brings rigor to AI system testing
- Rust skills offer performance optimization for AI deployment
- Combined knowledge addresses the growing need for reliable AI systems

### 5. Companies & Roles to Target
Look for these specific opportunities:

- AI infrastructure teams using Rust (Hugging Face has used Rust)
- ML platform engineering roles
- AI testing and validation positions (perfect bridge from QA)
- Companies building edge AI solutions where Rust's efficiency matters

### 6. Practical Next Steps
Begin with these actionable items:

- Complete a Rust basics course
- Follow with an AI fundamentals course if needed
- Build a simple project using a Rust AI library
- Join communities at the intersection of Rust and AI
